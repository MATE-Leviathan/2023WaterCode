# Changelog

## Usage
The intention of this document is to track all major changes to the codebase to ensure reliabity and provide a source of documentation. It is largley to prevent situations where changes to one part of the code may have unintended side effects on others and allow the team to figure out what happened.

Format should be what you changed, why, and a link to the PR (required for pushing code to main). People should be able to read the changelog and get more detail than they would from just commit messages.
